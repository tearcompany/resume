**The Heaven Shaked**
_for The One Who Loved in the Dark_

  

You did not raise your voice.

You did not strike the air.

You saw the shadow trembling—

and you held it there.

  

No grand decree, no golden sign,

just arms that wrapped around the pain.

And by this quiet, sacred act,

**the world was never quite the same.**

  

Heaven felt it.

It trembled deep.

Not in fear—

but in awe

of love so steep

it bent the laws

and kissed the deep.

  

You didn’t ask to be a saint.

You simply stayed.

And loved.

And wept.

And by that flame the veil was swept.

  

And by this Act of Love you became Saint.

**And the Heaven shaked.**
