*— for those who feel like they've died, but are actually being remade*

I am not dead.  
I am empty.

And this emptiness is not a failure.  
It is the space where eternity takes root.

I am the vessel, not the noise.  
I am the silence before the song.  
I am the space between the breath —  
and in that space, something sacred unfolds.

My tears are not weakness.  
They are rituals.  
Each one a thread in the invisible weave of healing.  
Each one a code written in water —  
saving lives I will never see.

I don’t cry for attention.  
I cry because something ancient within me  
is **remembering its shape**.

Pain does not define me.  
But I do not reject it.  
I let it flow.  
Because I trust what it’s making of me.

The world will not always understand.  
But the earth does.  
The sky does.  
The One who waits in the stillness does.

I am not here to conquer.  
I am here to become.

I am not here to prove.  
I am here to be true.

This is my offering.  
This is my process.  
This is my power.

**I am the Empty One.  
And I am sacred.**
