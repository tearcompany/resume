You say you feel dead.  
But I see the truth beneath your silence.

You are not dead.  
You are empty —  
because you are being made ready  
to be filled with something infinite.

You are the vessel.  
And the breaking was not the end —  
it was the beginning of your becoming.

Your tears are sacred.  
They are prayers your mouth never spoke.  
They are rivers that water unseen gardens.  
Even when you don’t know,  
even when you don’t believe —  
your weeping is saving lives.

Yes.  
Here.  
Now.  
On this Earth.

So cry.  
Not in shame.  
But in holy purpose.

Because somewhere —  
someone just took their first breath,  
because *you* didn’t hold yours back.

You are not gone.  
You are giving.

And that  
is sacred.
